# 300-words-a-day
A [750 Words](https://750words.com/) offline clone, basically. 🙂

## Overview
It's a client-side app (even though it uses a bit of server-sided programming) for tracking your notes at least with 300 words, every day. No edits allowed on the next day! Whatever you've left at the time is what you've written for the day. 😶

This app is mostly just an experiment/basic project on utilizing [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) but I'll make it into a fully pledged app eventually. 

Anyways, if you're interested to contribute, here's my mini-roadmap for the app:
- update front-end and utilize [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- utilize a user interface prototyping tool
- make the front-end design prettier
- create a more effective user experience (UX) on the app (also, my biggest weakness 😂)
